            <h3>Bar Chart</h3>
            <p>A bar chart provides a way of showing data values represented as vertical bars. It is sometimes used to show trend data, and the comparison of multiple data sets side by side.</p>

            <h3>Line Chart</h3>
            <p>A line chart is a way of plotting data points on a line. Often, it is used to show trend data, or the comparison of two data sets.</p>

            <h3>Mixed bar & line Chart</h3>
            <p>With Chart.js, it is possible to create mixed charts that are a combination of two or more different chart types. A common example is a bar chart that also includes a line dataset. When creating a mixed chart, we specify the chart type on each dataset.</p>

            <h3>Bubble Chart</h3>
            <p>A bubble chart is used to display three dimensions of data at the same time. The location of the bubble is determined by the first two dimensions and the corresponding horizontal and vertical axes. The third dimension is represented by the size of the individual bubbles.</p>

            <h3>Doughnut Chart</h3>
            <p>Doughnut chart is probably the most commonly used chart. It is divided into segment, the arc of each segment shows the proportional value of each piece of data. They are excellent at showing the relational proportions between data.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Pie Chart</h3>
            <p>Pie and doughnut charts are effectively the same class in Chart.js, but have one different default value - their <span class="code">cutout</span>. This equates to what portion of the inner should be cut out. This defaults to 0 for pie charts, and <span class="code">'50%'</span> for doughnuts. They are also registered under two aliases in the Chart core. Other than their different default value, and different alias, they are exactly the same.</p>

            <h3>Radar Chart</h3>
            <p>A radar chart is a way of showing multiple data points and the variation between them. They are often useful for comparing the points of two or more different data sets.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Polar Area Chart</h3>
            <p>Polar area charts are similar to pie charts, but each segment has the same angle - the radius of the segment differs depending on the value. This type of chart is often useful when we want to show a comparison data similar to a pie chart, but also show a scale of values for context.</p>
